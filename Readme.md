## About
This is a personal project done specifically for C-Site and any other desired business users. I built it to help business struggling without any use of inventory management software solutions, and its software would be used for business to understand efficiency of using a simple software tool and the possibilities of improving their workflow with proper solution. Its GUI is designed in Korean language but could be changed/redesigned to another language without difficulties. So far, only feature involves use of CSV file to work on the inventory management, but more efficient method can be applied such as use of exising DB from the user's business environment.

## Features
Open File: opens .csv file of 3 columns (ID, Name, Quantity) to display its information on the UI
Search: allows user to do case-insensitive search of any keyword
Change: allows users to change quantities of existing item, a main function of the inventory management system
Add: allows users to add new item with its ID, name, and quantity
Delete: allows users to delete specific item
